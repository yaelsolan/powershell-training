# PowerShell Training

This repository contains notes and practice commands from my first PowerShell training sessions.  
The content includes basic cmdlets, networking commands, process management, scripting fundamentals, and system queries.

File included so far:
- `powershell_notes_day1.ps1`

More scripts and structured automation will be added in the next stages as I progress.
